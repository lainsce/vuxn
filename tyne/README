# UFX Font Viewer

A modern GTK4 application for viewing and converting UFX bitmap font formats.

## Overview

UFX Font Viewer is a specialized tool for working with UFX bitmap font formats  
(UF1, UF2, UF3). The application provides a visual grid display of font glyphs  
and supports exporting to the BDF (Bitmap Distribution Format) for compatibility  
with various systems.

## Features

- View UF1 (8x8), UF2 (16x16), and UF3 (24x24) bitmap fonts
- Grid-based display with proper scaling and alignment
- Export to BDF format for use in other applications
- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with three main components:

- **application.vala**: Core application class and entry point
- **window.vala**: Window implementation with UI components and event handling
- **utils.vala**: Font format utilities and rendering code

## Font Formats

UFX Font Viewer supports the following formats:

### UF1
- 8x8 pixel glyphs (standard)
- 8x16 pixel glyphs (tall variant)
- Each glyph composed of 1 or 2 tiles

### UF2
- 16x16 pixel glyphs
- Each glyph composed of 4 tiles in a 2x2 arrangement

### UF3
- 24x24 pixel glyphs
- Each glyph composed of 9 tiles in a 3x3 arrangement

Each format includes a 256-byte header containing width information for each  
glyph.

## Dependencies

- GTK 4.x
- GLib 2.x
- Cairo graphics library
