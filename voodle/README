# Notepad App

A simple, lightweight notepad application inspired by classic Mac OS notes.
Built with **Vala** and **GTK4**, it supports basic text editing and task
checkboxes (`- [] task`).

## Features
- Minimalist design inspired by pre-OS X Mac notepad.
- Automatic conversion of `- [] task` into checkable tasks.
- A bottom bar with buttons for:
  - **New Note** (prompts to save before clearing the note).
  - **Save Note**.
  - **Load Note**.
