# Ditto - Image Dithering Application

Ditto is a GTK4 application for converting images to 1-bit or 2-bit color formats using Atkinson dithering, with a classic Macintosh System 1-6 styled user interface.

## Features

- Open images in PNG, BMP, or TGA formats
- Convert to 1-bit (black and white) or 2-bit (4 colors) mode
- Atkinson dithering for superior detail preservation
- Adjustable contrast control with 10 levels
- Save images in CHR format
- Classic Macintosh System 1-6 styling

## Building from Source

Requirements:
- Vala compiler
- GTK 4
- Meson and Ninja build system

Build Steps:
```bash
meson setup build
cd build
ninja
sudo ninja install
```

## Usage

- Ctrl+O to open an image
- Ctrl+S to save the dithered result
- Use the checkbox in the bottom-left to toggle between 1-bit and 2-bit modes
- Use the contrast slider in the bottom-right to adjust image contrast (1-10)

## About Atkinson Dithering

Ditto uses Atkinson dithering, developed by Bill Atkinson for the original Apple Macintosh. This algorithm offers better detail preservation than Floyd-Steinberg dithering by:

- Distributing only 3/4 of the error (vs. full error in Floyd-Steinberg)
- Using a pattern that reduces visual noise
- Preserving more diagonal lines and fine details
- Creating a cleaner, more deliberate pattern that's authentic to classic Mac applications
